# CODSOFT_PP_01

This project is a Python-based To-Do List application that helps users efficiently manage and organize their tasks. Designed as part of my internship, the application allows users to create, update, and track their tasks with ease. The goal is to provide a simple and effective solution, either through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI), enabling users to stay on top of their daily activities.

Key Features:

Add new tasks
Mark tasks as completed
Update or delete tasks
View pending or completed tasks
This project demonstrates the use of Python for building functional and user-friendly applications, highlighting my skills in handling file management, user input, and dynamic task tracking.
